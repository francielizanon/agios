/*! \file process_request.c
    \brief Implementation of the processing of requests, when they are sent back to the user through the callback functions. 

    That is done by the scheduling algorithms in two steps. First, while still holding the appropriate mutex for the data structure, process_requests_step1 has to be called to add requests in the dispatch, update counters, and fill a struct with information that can be given to the user. Then, in the second step, *after* having unlocked the mutex, the scheduler must call process_requests_step2 providing the struct filles by step1, and this function will use the user-provided callbacks to actually process the requests. That is done in two steps to avoid going back to the user while holding internal locks, and also to be less dependent on the time the user expends in its callbacks.
