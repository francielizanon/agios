/*! \file agios_add_request.c
    \brief Implementation of the agios_add_request function, used by the user to add requests to AGIOS.

    The request will be added to queues and statistics will be kept. The data structure used to keep the requests is either a timeline or the hashtable, depending on the currently used scheduling algorithm.
